# TagCloud Extension
=================

## Version 0.2

This is a simple extension, based on AngularJS framework, that, each time it is activates, 
parses the currently shown page and creates a Tag Cloud with the 100 most used words in it (100 is by default, but can be set to any number).

Once the Tag Cloud is shown, every Tag can be clicked and its text will be added to a search bar above the tags: 
then the content of the search bar (which is, of course, also editable) can be then searched for on Google, Twitter, Facebook or Quora.

## Acknowledgments
This extension is based on a few libraries, so there are a number of people I'd like to thank for their work:

* **AngularJS** team, for their amazing work on this great tool;
* **JQuery** team, for the same reason above;
* Mike Bostock, for his **D3js** library (really awesome);
* Jason Davies, for his **Word Cloud** plugin for _D3_;
